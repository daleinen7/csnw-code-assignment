# Find Expressions That Equal 100

## Prompt

Write a program that creates arithmetic expressions by inserting + or - or nothing between the ordered digits 1,2,â€¦,9 such that the expression evaluates to 100. For example 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9 = 100, so this expression would be output by your program.

## Solutions

### Submitted Solution (Odometer)

Run `node solution.js` to see my solution. I was inspired by an odometer of a car. Each combination of '', '-' and '+' (converted to an array with the index representing 0, 1, 2), is found if the numbers increase from 00000000 to 22222222. The trick was converting the number to base 3 math so that we don't check combinations that aren't relavent (00000003 or 22972342 for example). After that everything fell into place.

### Randomize

This was the initial solution I came up with. The obvious problem is that some times this solution is very fast (in the initial first 10 times I tested it, once a solution was found on the first iteration of the while loop!), while sometimes it is very slow (sometimes over 1000 iterations, though the average is a little under 600 iterations). It's not very efficient, consistent, or flexible. Another problem is if there were no solution, this while loop would run forever.

What I did like about it though was it can return a different solution each time the program runs.

### Recursion

My second thought after Randomize. I ultimately found the odometer solution more straightforward and abandoned this approach. After finding the Odometer solution, I came back to this and got further with it. As of now it still doesn't work. I can console.log the iterations but I cannot return the answer.
